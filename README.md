## Project Conclusions

Coming from both React and React native background, it was a pretty smooth learning process for me to adopt flutter and dart. There were heaps of shared concept that helps the learning process and strengthen the concept that learned before. Overall, it seems to me that flutter is a pretty good technology and I'm keen on exploring and experimenting with this technology.
